I am Xiaoquan Sun. Currently, I am pursuing a master‚Äôs degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Previously, I obtained my bachelor‚Äôs degree from Central South University in 2024. Looking ahead, I am excited to pursue a doctoral degree in the upcoming fall of 2027. I was a visiting student at IRPN Lab, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) University, supervised by [Haoang Li](https://sites.google.com/view/haoangli/homepage). I keep a close connection with [Wenxuan Song](https://songwxuan.github.io/) from then on, who have been teaching me a lot.
